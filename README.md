# Fabricater 0.11.0.0
Designed and written by Z Cater

## Overview

These are the docs for *Fabricater*, a command-line MDL compiler written in Haskell.

The goals of my final project are:
1. To ensure that my compiler is MDL-compliant
2. To implement lights as symbols on the symbol table
3. To implement knob-based animations
4. To enhance the power of animation knobs beyond mere linear changes
5. To allow animation knobs to modify lighting colors and pointlight positions
